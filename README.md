Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

Snow source code adapted from: https://gist.github.com/nickjevershed/0c1401ff5baae4efb9ff

This project is an experiment of trying to create a 2D semi-interactive ski mountain. The user is able to click along the mountain to "ski" along it. I have also included small 'Easter eggs' to add interactive/animated elements. Overall, the 2D element allowed me to add the characters from South Park and make the whole scene come together. That wasn't my initial intention, nevertheless, it added additional humor to this assignment and also made it more fun.

Design:
I created mutliple shapes with different designs and colors to create a landscape for my game. I added a "Welcome" pop-up to introduce the user to basic movement within the game and asssits them with operating the skier. I was able to integrate images/character from South Park into my scene to make a fun environment. 

Technical:
I included multiple interactive elements including click events to move the skier and keydown events to alter the game as the user wanted. Additionally, I also added 'snow' to make the scene coem together as a Winter Wonderland. Finally, I also included constraints for the skier so that they could only move along the mountain.
