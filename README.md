## Technical Achievement Desription -- 12
The technical achievement of this code lies in its power to create visual and dynamic data as well as its flexibility to be used as a base for more complicated and interactive future visualizations. The code has a building blocks ready to be expanded in html and its styles , SVG structures scalable vector graphs imaginable, the d3.js interactions to accommodate things like data-driven documents and D3 functions functions like select, append and attr. It has has text styling as well visual elements. 
## Design Achievement Description
The design achievements of this code are prominently focused on the creation of visually striking and well-structured data visualizations. The implementation of a thoughtfully chosen color scheme, featuring an animated central circle surrounded by rectangles in varying shades of gray and white, enhances the overall aesthetic appeal. The typography, comprising text with distinct sizes and colors, adds another layer of visual interest.

What sets this design apart is its unique approachâ€”everything converges at the center, allowing each element to shine independently with its own effects. The harmonious combination of fonts, colors, and shapes results in a visually captivating composition. This distinctive design not only draws attention to the central animated circle but also allows other elements to complement and enhance the overall visual experience.
