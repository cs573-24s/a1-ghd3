Grading
---

Grades are on a 120 point scale. 
96 points will be graded for functionality: the program does what the assignment requests with an informative README. 

We will use Google Chrome to view submissions. 
Be sure to test your code there.

Below are some, but not necessarily all, of the key points we will consider during grading:

- Circles and Rectangles  
- Lines  
- Paths  
- Different colors  
- README Quality
    - A description of what you have created. 1-2 screenshots are recommended for the README.  
    - A working link to the hosted files (usually the gh-pages 'live' url)  
    - Section for Technical and Design Achievements

Technical Achievement Desription -- 12  
Design Achievement Description -- 12

Remember, it is up to *you* to define what constitutes a technical and design achievements.
Be ambitious as these are designed to allow you to shape your learning.
These are the only way to move from B to A territory.

(3) technical achievement

The technical achievements in the provided D3.js code lie in its effective utilization of the library's capabilities. The seamless integration of SVG elements for circles, rectangles, lines, and polygons demonstrates a solid grasp of D3's data binding and manipulation features. The use of a declarative approach simplifies code readability, making it easy to understand and maintain. The inclusion of the D3.js library from an external source emphasizes a best practice, ensuring developers access an optimized version and promoting code efficiency.

(4) design achievement

Using different color to show the different shapes. This makes it more clear
