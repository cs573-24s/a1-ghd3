Abigail Albuquerque - Assignment 1 - Hello World: Github and d3
---
For assignment 1, I have created a visual of a square cat, sitting next to a tree in the sun. Additionally, I created an interactive feature in the form of a button that can toggle the image between day and night. During the "night", the sun disappears and the background turns to dark blue.

Technical achievements:
--
The major technical achievement for me in this project was learning the basics of d3 and learning how to use github pages. I also created an interactive element in the program. The interactive element includes a button that can toggle the picture between day and night. When the button is clicked, elements in the picture change colors.

Design achievements:

In this project, I have achieved the basic design achievements of using shapes like rectangles, lines, squares, circles and polygons. Additionally I have also used "path" to create inordinary shapes like curved lines, as can be seen with the cats tail.
