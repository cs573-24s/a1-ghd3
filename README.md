For this assignment I created a soccer field. The field has a yellow ball in the center of it and two goals. When the ball is clicked, it moves towards the right goal, when it is clicked again it moves towards the left goal. If the ball is scored, it changes color to match the team that scored it, and the score board text is upated to reflect the game score. I feel that the creation of the working score board and the "minigame" format of my visualization are technical and design achievements that go beyond the scope of the assignment.
