The illustration includes the required shapes (circles, rectangles, lines, polygons, paths in different colors) to create animals, a train, and a background. You can also change the passengers to the other train by dragging.

Grading

Grades are on a 120 point scale. 
96 points will be graded for functionality: the program does what the assignment requests with an informative README. 

We will use Google Chrome to view submissions. 
Be sure to test your code there.

Below are some, but not necessarily all, of the key points we will consider during grading:

- Circles and Rectangles  
- Lines  
- Paths  
- Different colors  
- README Quality
    - A description of what you have created. 1-2 screenshots are recommended for the README.  
    - A working link to the hosted files (usually the gh-pages 'live' url)  
    - Section for Technical and Design Achievements
