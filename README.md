# Data Visualization Assignment 1

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple data visualization using D3.js to create a force-directed graph. The visualization includes nodes of different shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle, and pentagram) connected by links. Additionally, nodes can be dragged.

## Technical Achievement Desription

I successfully implemented a dynamic force-directed graph using D3.js. Key features include designing nodes representing different shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle, pentagram) with links connecting them. The relationships are defined through data structures.
