# Assignment 1

## Basic Requirements

I tested out funcionalities such as creating rectangles, circles, lines, and polygons
and adding them to svgs on the page.

## Additional Tasks

I experimented with D3 functionality to select multiple elements, or singular elements
and tinkered to understand how this selection works.
Along with that, I also tinkered with D3\'s polygonHull function, which creates a polygon with the least amount of edges enclosing all points in a list.

I used this to create a fun button that would spawn randomly generated polygons at
random locations in a given svg. I also randomized the colors on each click as well

### Sources

I researched D3 on websites such as [This website on polygons](http://using-d3js.com/05_09_polygons.html)
as well as [This website on random colors](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13563471/random-colors-for-circles-in-d3-js-graph).
I also referred to [This website](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/shape.html) and [This website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-d3-js-in-5-minutes-c5ec29fb0725/)
to learn how to make shapes / polygons
