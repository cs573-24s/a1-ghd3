# Interactive Seesaw Graphic with D3.js

## Description

This project is an interactive graphic built with d3.js, showcasing a seesaw motion effect. When users click on either the circle or the rectangle, the elements on the screen animate to mimic the movement of a seesaw. 

### How It Works

Upon clicking the red circle or the blue rectangle, the position of the SVG line, the angle of the rectangle, and the placement of the circle change accordingly to simulate a seesaw tilting. The transition is smooth and reflects a realistic seesaw motion, leveraging d3's capabilities for DOM manipulation based on data changes.

## Technical Achievements

- Implemented an SVG line to act as the seesaw, with pivot dynamics based on user interaction.
- Used d3's data-driven approach to update the transformation properties of SVG elements, providing a real-time interactive experience.
- The angle of the seesaw is calculated and updated dynamically, giving a realistic sense of balance and weight distribution.

## Design Achievements

- Designed the SVG elements with a minimalist aesthetic to focus user attention on the interaction.
- Ensured that the interaction is intuitive â€“ a simple click triggers the animation, making the seesaw move.
